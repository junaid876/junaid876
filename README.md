## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔥 **AI-Powered Surveillance System for Abnormal Activity Detection**
Real-time intelligent surveillance using deep learning to detect abnormal human behavior.  
This project uses a **Spatial-Temporal AutoEncoder (STAE)** trained on normal actions and flags anomalies in video streams based on prediction loss.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Keras (CNN, ConvLSTM, Conv3DTranspose), NumPy, Tkinter, PIL, imutils  
**Key Features:**
- Preprocess & normalize surveillance frames  
- Train STAE model using Conv3D & ConvLSTM  
- Detect abnormal events in real time  
- GUI-based interface  
- Alerts for abnormal human activities (running, violence, etc.)
